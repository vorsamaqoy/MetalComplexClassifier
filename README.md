# MetalComplexClassifier
The repository serves as Supporting Information for an article being published.
The MetalComplexClassifier is a machine learning model based on the ExtremeBoostingClassifier. The model, trained on metal complexes, is capable of accurately and precisely predicting those compounds that are able to absorb visible light within a specified wavelength range of electromagnetic radiation. This capacity renders the compounds highly promising agents for therapeutic modalities that employ light, including photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT). Moreover, a single decision tree was trained for this purpose, and its architectural design contributed to the formulation of a potential active complex derived from an initial inactive complex. The code provides instructions for analyzing the tree structure to identify leaf nodes, pure leaf nodes, and the number and types of samples classified in those nodes.
